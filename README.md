# ToughMudderRedesign

I wanted to expand on a class project I had to redesign a mobile website to be more friendly in terms of UX/UI. I am using this repository to now code the project (adobe XD files) and make any changes needed.

This site is in no way affiliated with Tough Mudder or the Spartan Race company. It started as a class project to redesign the Mobile UX/UI of a website. I decided to take it one step further and create a responsive homepage for this website using my knowledge of HTML and CSS.
